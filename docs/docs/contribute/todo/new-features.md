# Build new features

<!-- ## Open Core vs Entreprise Features

Most features in Meemaw fall under the Open Core. The Open Core is and will remain fully open and free, under the AGPLv3 licence.

In the future, we will also develop entreprise features that will use a different licence. Here are a few examples of things that will probably fall under the entreprise features :
* Analytics & Reporting
* Monitoring
* Backups
* Hardware storage -->

## Roadmap

## Github issues - feature
[verify no one is working on it]
[ask on Discord if team would be ready to accept and review it, do not start without being synced with the team]

When you want to contribute a new feature (which is awesome \<3), please get in touch with us on Discord so that we can discuss priorities and roadmap. It would be a shame to develop something on your own that does not fit the overall vision for Meemaw or that would fall under entreprise features.
