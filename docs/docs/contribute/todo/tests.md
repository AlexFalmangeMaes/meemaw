# Add more tests

Improving tests is always useful. The objective is not necessarily to add a crazy number of tests, although adding more would still certainly help, but mostly to make sure we test our code in a smart way. We need to make sure to protect our code from our future selves and from mistakes down the line. We also need to make sure our security remains extremely high.
