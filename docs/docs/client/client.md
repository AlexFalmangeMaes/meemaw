# Client SDKs

As we've seen in the [getting started](/docs/getting-started), you need to use one of our client SDKs for a fully working installation. Our client SDKs allow you to effortlessly integrate Meemaw and abstracting the complex TSS operations away.

Here is the current list of platforms supported :
* [iOS](/docs/client/ios)
* [Web](/docs/client/web)

We are actively working on supporting more platforms and frameworks, in particular: Android, Flutter & React Native.
