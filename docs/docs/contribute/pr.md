# How to push change

In order to make it easier to maintain Meemaw, we all need to follow a few good practices when pushing changes :
* Communicate with the team on Discord before starting development to make sure everyone is on the same page
* Run all tests locally before creating a push request
* Create a push request on the development branch :
    * Provide clear information on what the changes are and why they are useful
    * Copy paste the [Copyright Transfer Agreement](https://github.com/getmeemaw/meemaw/blob/main/CTA.md) to make sure we can use your changes
    * Note: creating the push request will run all tests
