# Code of conduct

We want this community to be welcoming, joyous and helpful ðŸ˜Š This should be a happy place for everyone involved. Be nice, your Grandma could be watching. We are all in this together.

In order to make it happen, we just follow those 3 rules as a group:
* **No assh\*le**

* **No a\*\*hole**

We will remove any message that goes against those rules ðŸš«

We're happy to discuss and are all hears for feedback so that we can improve as a community. Please do not think that providing helpful feedback will be considered as a bad move. Just make sure you deliver it in a way to makes us all want to move forward and work together towards our mission.
